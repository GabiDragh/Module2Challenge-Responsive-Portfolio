# Module2Challenge-Responsive-Portfolio
Week 2 Bootcamp Challenge Project

## Description

Created a personal portfolio using information gained this week. 

The header consists of name and a navigation bar linked to the page sections.

The banner is an image with a title attached on top. 

The main section of the page is formed of 3 parts: About me, Work and Contact me. The flex display was used to separate each individual section into 2 columns of unequal sizes. 
Then, the Work section information has been structured using the grid display, where each project occupied space on a 2x4 grid. Each image has a heading title describing the project.

Last, the contact me section has been created using flexbox display for the 2 main sections (title and content) and then the content has been organised using the flex property again.
